sudo apt-get purge firefox

Delete .mozilla/firefox/ in your home directory, should it still be there

Delete .macromedia/ and .adobe in your home directory, these can contain "Flash Cookies" stored by the browser. The same is true, if applicable, for Silverlight (Moonlight) and other plugins, they can allow websites to store data on your computer.

Delete /etc/firefox/, this is where your preferences and user-profiles are stored

Delete /usr/lib/firefox/ should it still be there

Delete /usr/lib/firefox-addons/ should it still be there

Se puede hacer todo con un solo comando poniendo:

sudo apt-get purge firefox && sudo rm -Rf .mozilla/firefox/ .macromedia .adobe /etc/firefox/ /usr/lib/firefox/ /usr/lib/firefox-addons/
